MacOSX-specific notes
================================================================================

SDLU has not been tested under Mac OSX, but it should build (and work) without
any problems, since OS X is a UNIX system in its core.

If you encounter any issues, please report them in the issue tracker:

    http://bitbucket.org/sdlu/sdlu/issues

Building SDLU.framework
================================================================================

To build "SDLU.framework", use frameworkbuild.sh:

    $ cd <SDLU>/scripts/build-scripts
    $ ./frameworkbuild.sh

This will first build the library using configure. If you have already built the
library, you can pass it as an argument to avoid building it again:

    $ cd <SDLU>/scripts/build-scripts
    $ ./frameworkbuild.sh /path/to/libSDLU.dylib /path/to/SDLU_config.h

NOTE: The paths to libSDLU.dylib and SDLU_config.h should be absolute and not
relative to the current directory.
