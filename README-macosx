MacOSX-specific notes
================================================================================

SDLU has not been tested under Mac OSX, but it should build (and work) without
any problems, since OS X is a UNIX system in its core.

If you encounter any issues, please report them in the issue tracker:

    http://bitbucket.org/sdlu/sdlu/issues

Building SDLU.framework
================================================================================

To build SDLU as a framework, use frameworkbuild.sh:

    $ cd <SDLU>
    $ ./scripts/build-scripts/frameworkbuild.sh

This will create "SDLU.framework".
