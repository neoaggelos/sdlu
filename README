The SDL Utility Library (SDLU) is a cross-platform library that provides APIs
to make development of SDL2 applications faster and easier.

SDLU supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android and the Raspberry Pi.

SDLU is written in C, but can be natively used in C++.

It is distributed under the terms of the zlib license (see COPYING). The zlib
license allows static linking, as well as using independent parts of the library
in your source code freely, as long as you don't take credit for writing it.

See INSTALL for instructions on building the library. Check out the examples in
"test" to get started. Documentation can be found in the header files, and in
the bitbucket download page.

Main features:
* Fully featured button API with SDL2 event queue integration
* Cross-platform file chooser dialog
* API to mix pure OpenGL rendering calls with the SDL Render API
* Hardware-accelerated extensible 2D-Sprite API
* Powerful text rendering API with truetype font support
