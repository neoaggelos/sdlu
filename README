The SDL Utility Library (SDLU) is a cross-platform library that provides APIs
to make development of SDL2 applications faster and easier.

SDLU supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android and the Raspberry Pi.

SDLU is written in C, but can be natively used in C++.

It is distributed under the terms of the zlib license (see COPYING). For the
license of software and/or source code included in this distribution, see
COPYING-extra.

See INSTALL, README-cmake and README-configure for instructions on how to
build the library. Then, check out the examples in "test" to get started.
Documentation can be found in the header files in "include", and doxygen can
be used to generate the docs in HTML format.
