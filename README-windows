Windows-specific notes
================================================================================

SDLU has been tested under these Windows configurations:

Windows XP : Visual Studio 9-10, Cygwin
Windows  7 : Visual Studio 9-10-11, Cygwin
Windows  8 : Visual Studio 11

For Windows systems, static linking with the library should be preferred over
dynamic for a number of reasons, such as easier distribution of you programs
(as well as avoiding an issue with the cxx interface, see below).


================================================================================
Known bugs
================================================================================

Using the cxx interface with the DLL version will generate linking errors. This
does not happen with Cygwin, or with the static library.
