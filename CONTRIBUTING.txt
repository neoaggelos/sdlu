SDLU is an open-source project, and the best way to contribute to it is
by making a pull request. Here's a quick guide:

    * Make sure you have a bitbucket [1] account.
    * Fork the repository [2].
    * Add and commit your changes, prefer 1 commit for 1 bugfix/feature.
    * Make sure all the existing tests run successfully, so that your changes
      do not break anything.
    * Unless you make a change to the documentation, add a test, especially
      when adding features or fixing bugs.
    * Make sure the test actually works.
    * Push to the forked repo and submit a pull request.

Pull requests should meet the following criteria, but we won't shoot you
between the eyes, if they don't:

    * Four (4) spaces for indent, no tabs
    * No trailing whitespace
    * Changed code follows the conventions of the existing code
    * Add a test that fails without the change but works with it
    * Update the existing documentation as needed
