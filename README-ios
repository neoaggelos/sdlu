* SDL2_IOS_LIBRARY:     Full path to libSDL2.a
* SDL2_TTF_IOS_LIBRARY: Full path to libSDL2_ttf.a
* SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR:     Directory where SDL.h is located
* SDL2_TTF_INCLUDE_DIR: Directory where SDL_ttf.h is located

Then, open a shell and type:

    $ ./scripts/build-scripts/iosbuild.sh [options]

Available options ('./iosbuild.sh --help' for details):
* --architecture: Choose the architecture to build
* --sdk-version: iOS SDK version to use
* --iphoneos-min-version: The minimum iOS version your application requires
* --xcode-path: Directory where Xcode is installed


================================================================================
