================================================================================

The library offers an expiremental iOS port. It has not been tested, yet it
should work without any problems.


================================================================================
Requirements
================================================================================

* Mac OS X (10.5 or newer) with the iPhone SDK (3.0 or newer)
* SDL2 and SDL2_ttf for iOS (static)


================================================================================
Building with Xcode (Recommended)
================================================================================

Run CMake Gui and set:
* Generator name to Xcode
* IOS_PLATFORM to either OS or SIMULATOR
* SDL2/SDL2_TTF_LIBRARY and SDL2/SDL2_TTF_INCLUDE_DIR
* BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF
* BUILD_STATIC_LIBS to ON
* Use the toolchain file '<SDLU>/scripts/cmake/toolchains/ios.cmake'

Hit configure and then generate. Then, use the Xcode project files to build
the library.


================================================================================
Building from command line
================================================================================

First, set the following variables:

* SDL2_IOS_LIBRARY:     Full path to libSDL2.a
* SDL2_TTF_IOS_LIBRARY: Full path to libSDL2_ttf.a
* SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR:     Directory where SDL.h is located
* SDL2_TTF_INCLUDE_DIR: Directory where SDL_ttf.h is located

Then, open a shell and type:

    $ ./scripts/build-scripts/iosbuild.sh [options]

Available options ('./iosbuild.sh --help' for details):
* --architecture: Choose the architecture to build
* --sdk-version: iOS SDK version to use
* --iphoneos-min-version: The minimum iOS version your application requires
* --xcode-path: Directory where Xcode is installed
